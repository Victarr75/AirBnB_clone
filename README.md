# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified version of the AirBnB website, covering fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track. The project consists of several components including a command interpreter, a website with static and dynamic content, a database (or file storage), and an API for communication between the front-end and data.

## Components

1. **Command Interpreter:** 
   - This component allows manipulation of data without a visual interface, similar to a Shell. It's ideal for development and debugging purposes.

2. **Website (Front-end):**
   - The front-end of the project displays the final product to users. It includes both static and dynamic content to provide a seamless user experience.

3. **Database or Files:**
   - Data is stored either in a database or files. Objects representing various aspects of the AirBnB clone (e.g., listings, users) are stored and managed here.

4. **API (Application Programming Interface):**
   - The API serves as a communication interface between the front-end and the data storage. It allows operations such as retrieval, creation, deletion, and updating of data objects.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into distinct modules for each component. The structure may look like this:

airbnb_clone/
├── command_interpreter/
├── website/
│ ├── static/
│ └── dynamic/
├── database/
│ ├── models.py
│ └── storage.py
└── api/
├── routes.py
└── controllers.py

## Usage

1. **Command Interpreter:**
   - Run the command interpreter module to manipulate data via command-line interface.

2. **Website:**
   - Access the website through a web browser to view and interact with the AirBnB clone.

3. **API:**
   - Utilize the API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the data.
